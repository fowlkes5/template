			<p>1. I believe that this video was both personal and an outreach to the youth.  It was personal in that he wrote a letter to his uncle, who was also gay, and wished that he was still alive so that he can help and be there for him through the hardships that Ronnie faced because he was gay.  The other is to show that it is okay to love no matter what your sexual preferences may be.  No matter what anybody says, if you’re homosexual, bisexual, or heterosexual, hell is not awaiting for you.</p>
