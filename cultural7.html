			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>Music, a truly remarkable phenomenon that we humans are blessed to have.  The power that it holds and the way it can influence us, even in the most subtle of ways, is something that is extremely befuddling.  Though being granted with such a blessing as music, does not mean that all of it is good music.  “Music can alter moods and talk to you.” says Eminem in one of his hit songs, Sing For The Moment.  That quote has more truth within it then anyone knows or can maybe even possibly comprehend.  The two genres of music that mainly do just that, are Hip-Hop and Rock.  Two of the most powerful forms within our society today.</p>
