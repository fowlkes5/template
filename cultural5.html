			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>The other genre of music that has great influence on the population, primarily teens, of today is Rock.  Rock has been an extremely popular form of music for about even as long as Hip-hop has.  There are many types of rock music also, such as blues, alternative, metal, hard rock, country rock, and many others.  This style of music, in actuality, is less negative regarding the percentage of it that is negative compared to that of rap.  Its bad influence on the teens of today are even a little less severe then that of much of hip-hop as well.  But even so, rock has been around for many decades and the power it holds over many of the population of the United States, and even the world, is truly remarkable.</p>
