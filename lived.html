	  <p>Lived Experiences Project</p>     <p>Engineering, mechanical or civil, is the professional career path that I have chosen to pursue.  I have always had great interest in assembling, dissembling, and creating new inventions entirely since I was young.  So one piece of technology that intrigued me, though how simplistic it may at first seem, is the German Shoe-Shining Machine.  The new German Shoe-Shining Machine is an amazing break through for those who detest getting their hands dirty by using the more traditional shoe shining method.  For the experienced shoe shiner they know that it is quite impossible to not get your hands dirty when polishing manually.  You need to pick up the shoe to remove the dirt and soil, which may contain harmful bacteria.  These may include Salmonella, Listeria, and E.coli, which can be found at places like public restrooms.  So if you were to pick up your shoe to polish it after walking in a public restroom sometime during the day, and if it were to have the disease Salmonella on its surface, you could be in trouble.  For example, if a person were to then eat a sandwich after cleaning shoes, thatâ€™s a high risk of food poisoning, so why take the chance?</p>	<p>But with this new break through technology, everything else is a thing of the past.  From touching your shoes, to getting your hands dirty, to contracting some kind of harmful disease.  All that is required for the Automatic ShoeShine is the Automatic ShoeShine and, of course, your shoe(s).  Now when polishing your shoes with this marvelous contraption, all you need to do is put the tip and sides of the shoe to the spinning brushes.</p>	<p>Also, when it comes to those many who have the habit of shining their walk-wear at the last possible minute, this is indefinitely the solution.  When fully dressed in remarkable attire and rushing to get to work, a special occasion, or maybe even a job interview, but your shoes are not up to par, no problem.  It will only take 10 seconds of your time.  Because who would want to walk in a job interview looking nearly flawless but wearing unsightly dress shoes?</p>	<p>This outstanding new breakthrough in technology has many benefits.  In less than 10 seconds your shoes could look as good or even better than when you first bought them.  You do not have to ever touch your possibly disease attracting shoes again.  When presented in hotels or such establishments it will be an excellent attraction for people.  It will be an eye-catching decoration in almost any office because of its extraordinary German design.  The costs per shine at an establishment go as low as 4 cents.  All models come with a 3 year warranty except for the Easy Comfort home unit (which only comes with one year).  Finally, the Automatic ShoeShine is used everywhere.</p>	<p>There are four different models to the German shoe-shining system.  First is the Easy Comfort, which is more like a miniature version of the others, lightweight, and can be placed almost anywhere.  Next is the Cosmo, a more elegant form than the others, it will look fantastic with any sort of furnishing and comes in a multitude of colors.  The third model, the Cosmo Plus, is an upgraded version of the Cosmo.  This is so because of its finely polished stainless steel handle bar, which provides a secure balance when shining shoes and is equipped with a start button that, as long as it is held down, activates the shoe-shining process.  Now last, but is certainly not least, is the Ellipse V2A, which has the most unique form of all the models and because of its design, will be the main attraction in any open area.</p>	<p>Breakthroughs in technology such as these are what is expiring me to further pursue the field of either mechanical or civil engineering.  I find it quite remarkable at how such simple ideas and notions can branch out into something grander and become part of the norms of everyday life in order to help others and make their lives more filled with bliss.  Such feats have only inspired me more so to continue down the path of an engineer and someday have my thoughts, ideas, and inventions become part of everyday life, for the benefit of all the people.</p><p>Reference</p><p><a href="http://www.shoe-shine.com.au/">shoe-shineinfo</a></p>
